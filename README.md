# Desmos offline for pc
I found this Desmos HTML code on GitHub, so I used Python Eel to make it a desktop app because I wasted a lot of time finding a Desmos offline alternative (I probably spelled that wrong). I hope this makes it easier for you. You can find the original HTML code [here](https://github.com/e841018/OfflineDesmos).

Thanks to [Ashu](https://github.com/e841018) for whatever witchcraft you did there. I also want to thank the Desmos developers, but why didn't you just make a desktop version? I know you have a version for Chromebooks 
not everyone has a consistent internet connection.

Yeah I forgot ... you need chrome installed.
and CSS is GAY
